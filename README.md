A Public Repo, currently in progress. A collection of Datastructures Implementations along with Algorithms Implementations.
It's meant to be used as a quick revision for interview prep.


A fun little way to interact with this project if you're interested.

After installation, and project setup, run the command "make start".

Additional Pointers:
- The above only works for macOS
- To interact with the GUI use the "up", "down" arrow keys, "enter" key and "q" key
- Uncomment the execute functions in the files under the questions folder, to view function outputs.
